# 👋 Welcome

Hi! I’m Jerome Richardson, I am currently enrolled in GIS course at Temple University. I decided to take this class because it peeked my curiousity, in high school I always enjoyed georgraphy over any other subject. I hope this course will be beneficial to my career pathways moving forward.
